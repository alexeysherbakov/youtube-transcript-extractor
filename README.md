# youtube-transcript-extractor
A Python script for extracting and punctuating transcripts from YouTube videos.

This project includes a straightforward and functional Python script that automates the process of fetching transcripts from YouTube videos. The script takes a YouTube URL as an input, extracts the video transcript, punctuates it using an external API, and saves the result as a text file. It uses the youtube_transcript_api package for transcript retrieval and the Bark Punctuator API for punctuating the transcripts.
